# Project 48
This project is designed to be a sucsessor to Project 2025, except openly written and to enhance rights, instead of stripping them away.

Various initiatives will receive seperate repos to allow for managing discussion, issues, and pull requests.

Both the contribuiting and the code of conduct files are to be housed in the .github repo.

It should be noted that while this project is designed to write recomendations for officials to (hopefully) implement, this project does not and will not officially endorse any canidates, officials, parties, etc. Individuals may, however their views are not to be taken as the official position of the Project as a whole.

A more complete document will be avalible soon.

Live discussion is currently avalible on Discord due to a current lack of a alternative. https://discord.gg/X5fMD77UsK
